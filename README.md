In this challenge, we are tasked with cleaning a dataset of mice and their tumor volumes and then doing analysis such as creating charts and finding statistics 
that allow us to take a look at which drugs are doing the best for the tumors. There are charts such as boxplots, linecharts, pie charts, barcharts, and scatterplots which all 
provide analysis on the merged data set of the mice and their treatments.
